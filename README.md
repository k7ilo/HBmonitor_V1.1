**Because the original HBMonitor by N0MJS and other forks are no longer being developed per their specific author's,
this is my attempt to maintain to some degree and with limited support, the most (to my knowledge) used version of HBMonitor.**

**My version, forked from SP2ONG's version, as of right now only includes some very small changes
mainly sorting out the index.html page and removing a few things to make it easier to customize.**

**I will be adding installation instructions as soon as I am done with my version of the install script which will include
a Debian version check being that this has been tested on only Debian 10 and Debian 11**

**You can try to use a more updated version by OA4DOA called FDMR-Monitor found here => https://github.com/yuvelq/FDMR-Monitor
which was forked from HBMonitor V2 (HBMon2, not suppored anymore per author) by SP2ONG 2019-2022**

Though it has been recommend in the pass not running HBmonitor on the same computer as HBlink3, I have not had any issues in doing so.<br>
