**Because the original HBMonitor by N0MJS and other forks are no longer being developed per their specific author's,**
**this is my attempt to maintain, to some degree and with limited support, the most commonly used version of HBMonitor**
**which my version which includes some small changes so far, was forked from SP2ONG's version**

**You can try to use a more updated version provided by OA4DOA found at https://github.com/yuvelq/FDMR-Monitor**

Though it has been recommend not running HBmonitor on the same computer as HBlink3, I have not had any issues in doing so.
